# Pavitra-Conflation-Model
Pavitra Vivekanandan

I will be working on Project C.


Compare small language model with performance of current matcher for place conflation and provide comparative analysis of improvement.

OKRs

Objective: evaluate improvement of place conflation using language models

Key Results:

Achieve at least 90% F1 score (or precision/recall balance) on the test dataset using a language model

Run inference within 50 ms per match on average, using a low-cost 

Identify and recommend the model with the best price-to-performance ratio among baseline and small LLM
